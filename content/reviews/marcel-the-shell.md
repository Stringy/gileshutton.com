I'm not the sort of person to seek out film trailers, or keep on top of new
releases. When I see a trailer, it is almost always when I am sitting in the
cinema to see something different, my hand is rummaging around at the bottom of
an already empty popcorn bag, and I'm getting bored of the adverts[^1]. In the
case of Marcel the Shell with Shoes On (henceforth referred to as the far
simpler, Marcel, or Marcel the Shell) I was watching a fairly fairly mediocre
Jim Broadbent film. The trailer for Marcel blew me away instantly.

Waiting is for those with more time than me, so I bought it on Amazon and dove
straight in and what an incredibly charming, tragic, hilarious, and beautiful
film it is too.

Marcel the Shell is a feature-length film based on a series of short videos
published to YouTube around twelve years ago. Marcel is a stop-motion animated
shell, living with his grandmother after the rest of his community went missing
a couple of years prior. The story is shot from the perspective of Dean who
meets Marcel when he moves into the house that Marcel resides in[^2]. What
follows is an incredibly well crafted journey through discovery and loss, all
through the charmingly funny musings of Marcel himself.

The dialogue especially blew me away, to the extent that half way through the
film I exclaimed, quite geuinely, my surprise that someone had actually sat down
with their favourite writing implement and written
it. Smarter people than me have said that good dialogue is invisible, it doesn't
draw attention to itself, it is natural and immersive, and moves the story
forward. This is helped, perhaps, by the documentary framing device, where
Marcel is free to talk within the bounds of his own thoughts without forwarding
an actual _plot_, but it is seamless throughout.

I can't mention the dialogue without also mentioning Jenny Slate, whose
performance as Marcel is perfect. Before this film, I had only seen her in Parks
and Rec, where she plays a spoilt but hilarious rich-kid. A world away from this
more nuanced role.

Overall, it is easily my favourite film I've seen this year and one I will
definitely revist more than a few times. Was this review too gushing? Maybe. Who
cares. It's a great film, and I loved it.

[^1]: Why is it that there are more adverts for random crap than there are
  trailers for films?[^3]

[^2]: Dean is also the real-life creator of the original videos

[^3]: I know the answer, and I don't like it.
