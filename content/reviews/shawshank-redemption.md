Well, I for one certainly didn't expect to be writing another review so quickly.
But I suppose *Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption* is a novella, sitting
pretty at a mere 128 pages, so it did not take long to finish at all. 
It's another book that I decided to read because I've seen the film loads of 
times. It's a fantastic film, and often cited as one of the best films of all time.
Surely the novella that spawned such a film will be of equal quality? Well... yes and no.

*Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption* is the story of Andy Dufresne's incarceration
in Shawshank State Prison, and his challenges in adjusting to prison life after
a conviction for a crime he claims he did not commit. All this told in the 
memoirs/diary of his prison friend Red, the man who can get you things.

It's interesting perhaps that I wrote about King's incredible character voices
in my previous review, but I felt that it wasn't nearly as strong in Shawshank.
That's not to say that Red is a bad character, or that the writing is less 
engaging or more difficult to read, but it didn't land nearly as well for me this time.
There could be an argument for my experience being hampered by seeing the film - 
Morgan Freeman's performance is excellent, as always - and that leads me neatly
onto the second quibble.

The film is better. There. I said it. The film takes the source material, rounds
off some of the edges, combines characters together for great effect, and even
comes up with far better plot resolution. For example, in the film Andy works for 
the prison guards, doing their tax returns and eventually facilitating a lot
of questionable deals and money laundering for the Warden. At the end, the warden
and the chief guard all get their comeuppance for their crimes, after Andy
escapes and reveals the whole racket. In the book, Andy works for their money
laundering racket and ... they retire. It's too neat and tidy. The
film drastically improves a few plot points, tying off loose ends in a
way that is satisfying and realistic compared to the neat and convenient resolutions
in the book. Another one is Brooks, who is mentioned briefly in a throwaway line,
but forms a heartwrenching storyline in the film.

But I really enjoyed the book all the same. I read it in an afternoon, such was
the quality of the writing (and indeed the length). It's told in a very similar 
way to The Green Mile, with Red recounting his life in prison and particularly 
about Andy Dufresne. The most interesting theme for me was Andy's stoicism in 
the face of significant adversity. It reminded me a lot of *Man's search for meaning* 
by Viktor Frankl. There are those that choose to be happy, choose to live a good 
meaningful life, even in prison, or even in the worst place ever thought up by 
human minds - a concentration camp. It is all summed up in what is possibly one
of the finest lines I've read in any book: 

*"It always comes down to two choices. Get busy living, or get busy dying."*
