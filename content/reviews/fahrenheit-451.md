This one has been on my virtual bookshelf for quite some time. I even have a
physical copy that I bought, as I tend to do with physical books, with the 
greatest intentions of reading it immediately, but it very quickly gathered dust
on my shelf. I'm a big fan of the cover, for its vibrant colours but minimal
look. It's not the best *Fahrenheit 451* cover I've seen -- there's a fantastic
all-black one that reveals the title only when you heat/burn the page -- but still,
I enjoyed it.

The book itself is an interesting one. I finished it last night and yet I'm 
still not sure what I really feel about it. Perhaps I'll have a better idea by 
the end of this article. But it's a classic. It has won dozens of awards, and is
lauded by critics. Of course it's for those reasons that I picked it up to begin
with, but now that I've read it I'm not so sure. I certainly enjoyed it but not
quite to the extent that I expected to.

The book follows Guy Montag, a fireman responsible not for putting fires out,
but for setting fire to books and houses and sometimes the people who get in the way.
Set in a dystopian future full of book burning, censorship, mechanical manhunting
dogs, and a placid population glued to their parlour screens, the book paints a
picture of a society with scary parallels to our own. It's even scarier writing
this in 2022, when the book was written seventy years ago! There is exploration
of the consequences of book burning and censorship, of widespread hedonism, of
the bystander effect.
One character asks why you'd ever want to read a book because it'll challenge
your perspective and make you miserable. It's fascinating and scary and almost
too relatable.

However.

The way it explores this is in long monologues and dialogue between characters, and it comes
across as a little too on the nose. It's hitting you over the head with it for 
much of the book, and everything else, where there are consequences for the
actions of the characters, feels rushed and simple in comparison. It's a book
that is standing on a soap box and making a point, and it's an exceptional point
to make, but not one that lends itself to a deep and enjoyable read.

However. 

The writing itself is incredible, and I think I'll reread it a second time just
for a closer understanding of what makes the writing so good. The first time I
picked this book up, I was put off by the language and dialogue because it felt 
to me a little too airy and loose, particularly right at the start when Montag's 
world view is challenged by his neighbour, Clarisse. But I realise, that's sort 
of the point. It demonstrates Montag's confusion, and how distinctly different
the two people are in both how they see and react to the world around them. But 
Clarisse becomes the spark that ignites[^1] the change in Montag. There are few
wasted words throughout the entire book, everything has its place, everything is 
saying *something*.

The dialogue is really tight as well. I particularly enjoyed the conversations
between Montag and his wife Mildred. They are often mundane to the nth degree,
but it describes this disjointed relationship where she's not really paying attention
to what he's saying, and he's frustrated that she's not listening to his revelations
about his life or his job. They're having two different conversations, at each other,
without the other even realising. It's frustrating and awkward, but again it reinforces
that disconnected society, everyone in their own little world, their eyes closed
only focussing on the least challenging information they can deal with.

Unfortunately the end felt a little rushed and I finished the book wanting a little
more. There's so many questions about what's going on in the universe and what's 
going to happen afterwards. From the point Montag leaves Faber's house for the first
time it feels like Bradbury was racing towards the end, which is a shame because there 
are some incredible scenes dispersed amongst the rest. Perhaps this demonstrates the 
trade off of avoiding lots of exposition about the world and the situation? You 
get these small nuggets of insight into the society and the world, but you leave 
with more questions. I'm unsure how I feel about it. I don't think I want answers
to everything, but maybe a little more exposition could help.

Overall I enjoyed the book, and I'm glad I read it. It has long been on my reading
list and there's nothing quite as good as the hit of dopamine from drawing a thick
black line through an item on that list. It is also the book that has taken
me away from my beloved audiobooks and instead back to the "real thing" (if a Kindle
can be called a real book,) and that's got to be a good thing.
