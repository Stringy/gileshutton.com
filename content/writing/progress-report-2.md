The astute reader may notice that it has been over three months since my last
progress report. I'm sure you're thinking that in that time I must have a first
draft complete and publishers knocking down my door to publish it. I bloody 
wish.

But I have made progress. Much of the last three months has been spent doing a 
lot of seemingly nothing on the project. The reality is that I needed to get some
ideas and thoughts straight in my head before continuing with any writing. That 
took a lot of time, and that could probably be reduced by _actually writing stuff_,
but I try not to think about that too much.

I continue to discover parts of my process, and sticking to the original mechanism
I outlined in my last post about writing scenes instead of chapters, and moving to
new scenes the moment the idea is resolved or it gets less exciting. That's working
wonderfully. The obvious downside is that some of the scenes I've written will not 
end up in the finished product, but I think this is a natural and expected part of
my process. I've also discovered that I need to understand my characters better
before writing the scenes for them. Their motivations especially need to be worked out
ahead of time before I can write them properly. As I write this it sounds like obvious
stuff, but I expected to learn these things as I went along through discovery, but 
that doesn't seem to work for me.

Over the last three days I've had some time off from work and my plan was to spend
it writing the way I'd like to write, should this ever become a full-time gig. I've
got to say it has been excellent. In three days I've written about 6000 words (more or less
18 pages), 2000 each day. The words came easily, often pouring from my fingertips 
far faster than I expected them to. The jury is out of course as to whether they are
the right words, but I'll try not to think about that until the draft is done.

I'm sitting currently at around 30000 words total, and of those I consider about 20000 
part of the 'manuscript'. This accounts for the scenes I've dropped[^1] and makes the
final manuscript length about 100 pages. Not bad. Not great, mind you, especially after
three months, but not bad at all. The whole process is extremely challenging, not least because 
a tremendous amount of self-doubt creeps into each and every word. It destroys 
creativity and sometimes makes me want to purge my hard drive[^2] of the mess 
that I've written myself into. But I am getting better at turning off that part of
my brain, at least when I'm writing. It's the inbetweeny bits that get to me.

I've said it before, but I think it bears repeating -- consistency is key. If, 
instead of thinking about the story and writing notes and doing pretty much anything
_except_ write, I aimed for 1000 words per day over the last three months I'd have a
manuscript of around 90000 words[^3]. That's a novel. That's a damn novel in three months.
Over these past few days I've written a thousand words in a matter of a couple of hours, so
I don't think I have much of an excuse to continue like this. 2000 may be too much to juggle
with a full-time job, but 1000 feels very doable.

Over the weekend I was in Waterstones, skimming through a few books on the 
craft of writing, and in the introduction of one[^4] was a quote that somewhat 
encouraged me: _"A professional writer is an amateur who doesn't quit." - Richard Bach_

So I'm not going to quit.

      as 'forks in the road,' which has a nice accepting feel to it. I think it
      might have been Ursula K Le Guin

[^2]: Luckily, even if I did, I'd have cloud backups to save me when I eventually
      realise what an idiot I was being.

[^3]: This is of course assuming those thousand words come easily and I encounter
      no forks, but 90000 words is 90000 words.
