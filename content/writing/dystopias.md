I have been thinking a lot about dystopias recently, prompted by a precarious
visit to my old smuggling work-in-progress. My aim was to flesh out the world
building and establish precisely the kind of dystopia the unfortunate
main character lived within. Perhaps inevitably, as I waded into what I hoped to
be a sea of multidimensional compelling dystopia, I found a shallow imitation
of it.

The obvious questions is: what makes a compelling dystopia? Is it a political
satire, with the big bad government oppressing the people? Is it a social separation
of different kinds of people based on class, or thoughts, or where they live? Maybe
it is all of those things.

Some of the best dystopias I have ever seen or read are usually formed from society
adapting to a devastating situation in a realistic and relatable way. In _Children of Men_[^1],
no children have been born in twenty years. Society's focus has shifted. Everything is flat
and meaningless, with humanity slowly dying off, which leads people towards a hedonistic
lifestyle, or filling maternal voids with pets and animals. These are all understandable
if not relatable responses to that situation.

Another excellent, similar example comes from the _Love, Death, and Robots_[^2] episode _Pop Squad_,
where humanity have developed a drug that induces immortality. Faced with overpopulation,
breeding is forbidden, and police enforce this ban... by executing children. It is shocking
and horrific but at its core, on some level, it is _understandable_[^3]. The short
story follows one of these police officers as he comes to terms with what he is removing
from the world. For a story as short as it is, it packs an astonishing punch.

My point really is that a dystopia formed from some idea of how society might break
down is infinitely less compelling to me compared to a dystopia that has grown and
evolved from a series of unavoidable events. I had been looking at the world building
from the wrong angle. If you put all the pieces of your dystopia together then try to
justify why the world has ended up the way it has, then it might fall flat and come across
as too convenient. But if you take a simple premise and figure out how people would react
to it at that moment, and then in a year, then in five years, then in ten? You'll find
the small decisions, the little shifts in society, until the dystopia falls out of the
other side.

[^1]: The film is one of my favourites, and surprisingly better than the book.
[^2]: If you've not watched any of it, stop reading and go watch now.
[^3]: I'm not suggesting that this would be the first solution, or even the
      thousandth, but it is _a_ solution.
