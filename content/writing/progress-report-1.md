On Thursday last week, I started a new project. The previous thing I was working
on -- a thriller/dystopia thing about a smuggler -- had been in the works for 
literally years under various guises. What I learned from working on it for so long
is that sometimes you have to take your idea back behind the potting shed and shoot it
in the face. 

Luckily, it also taught me a thing or two about what my process looks like and
the most efficient ways for me to get words down on a page. In particular it 
taught me that any kind of plot or planning completely stiffled all creativity and
motivation in me, and that thinking too much ruins my drafts. This is perhaps contradicting
some of my previous posts, where I've mentioned that I need a little bit of a plan,
but this is an evolving process and I'm learning new things about it every time
my fingers hit the keyboard.

The new project, code name Twilight Phantom[^1], is a time travel thing. Since starting
just over a week ago, I have written no fewer than 12000 words. For me, that is an 
absolute miracle. _Many_ months have gone by without anywhere near that much progress.

Question is, what's different this time?

Firstly, I have no plan. Nothing at all[^3]. I don't know where I'm going at all, 
so I'm discovering things as I go along. So far the story has meandered around a little
as I settle on style and on certain ideas, but it's not as wandering as I expected.
I'm also not writing linearly. I've given up the idea of thinking in chapters, or 
even thinking about the beginning, middle, or end. I'm writing scenes as they come 
to me, and perhaps most interestingly of all, I stop writing a scene once I've conveyed
the central theme of the scene. It's all very disjointed, but I feel like I can fill
in the gaps once I have a collection of scenes that constitute the main events of the book.

I'm excited, and I'm riding this motivational wave as far as it will take me.
Stephen King says that a writer should charge through the first draft
as quickly as possible or the blade will become dull, and you'll lose your drive
and connection with your characters and story. I think that's true. After the years
I've spent trying to force through my last project, my mind is set on finishing the
draft of this one in a timely manner. I even have deadlines. Part of the reason I 
wrote so much this week is because I thought I could hit 10000 words in a week.
And so I did. It's weird how a minor piece of gamification can help so profoundly.


[^1]: I've decided that code names for in-progress projects is a good idea because
      titles are hard and otherwise I'd have many different directories named derivatives of "Who Knows"
      or "New Project 5." [^2]

[^2]: These are not imaginary examples.

[^3]: I do have a nebulous collection of notes, loose thoughts, and editing suggestions,
      but no real outline.
